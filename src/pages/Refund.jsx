        defective item or a wrong item sent to you, a store credit will be

        within 48 hours of delivery. Email us at info@animehouse.co.nz with the
        invoice number, contact information, and a list of defective items. For
        each item you must submit a photo of the defective item and its
        packaging materials and describe the damage that has occurred. Damages
        without accompanying documentation are NOT accepted. Please keep the
        shipment packaging in case of inspection by the shipping company. Once
        we have received the claim from you, along with the product images, our
        customer representative will inspect your order and contact you within
        five (5) business days. On approved damaged items that are $20.00 or
        less, you will receive an email with a store credit to be used during
        any future order on animehouse.co.nz. For items over $20.00 we will
